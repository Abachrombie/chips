<p>Unique digital signatures
    only one valid signature for message/pubkey pair</p>

<p>Unique &amp; publicly verifiable proof of sequential work</p>

<p>Unique &amp; signed proofs of space
    identity is a pubkey. proof cannot be generated by someone without privkey
    weak uniqueness – expectation is 1 proof for any challenge.
    sometimes more or less, but expected is 1</p>

<h2 id="trunk-and-foliage">Trunk and foliage</h2>

<p>Trunk is alternating PoS and VDFs</p>

<p>Block contains a PoS.
    Run a VDF on top of that to finalize the block
    Time it has to run is based on the hash of the PoS.
    Hardness parameter adjusts finalization time</p>

<p>The trunk is not grindable, because all values are unique</p>

<p>The foliage contains a signature with the corresponding secret key.
It signs the hash of the previous block and the proof of space and the set of txns.</p>

<p>Miners may come up with alternative foliage, because the header does not commit to the transactions.</p>

<p>Tradeoff: foliage can be rewritten. Trunk is near-canonical (can’t be ground effectively).</p>

<h2 id="spaceminer">Spaceminer</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Init by writing sectors</li>
  <li>Every time a block shows up, try to mine on top of it.</li>
  <li>Run the proving algorithm</li>
  <li>Publish the result if good</li>
</ol>

<p>Parameter kappa = 1, 2, 3 is the number of best heads we maintain
Miners don’t mine if they already have kappa local candidates for slot i</p>

<h2 id="timeminer">Timeminer</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Init</li>
  <li>Every time a block shows up try to mine on top of it</li>
  <li>Run the VDF on the block’s PoS until finalized</li>
  <li>If you have kappa threads or finalized blocks already: replace running if PoS is good.</li>
</ol>

<p>Miners don’t mine if they already have kappa local candidates for slot i</p>

<h2 id="chain-growth">Chain growth</h2>

<p>Every time a space miner makes a proof, he gets a quality which tells him how long it takes to finalize that block</p>

<p>Assumption: All proof of time miners are roughly equally fast</p>

<p>No Slowdown Lemma:
An adversary with unbounded space and parallelism (but cannot break the signature scheme) cannot slow down the growth process.</p>
