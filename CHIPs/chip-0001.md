## What is a CHIP?
A *CH*ia *I*mprovement *P*roposal (CHIP) is a formal design document that uses a standard format, which will be laid out in this document. CHIPs are the primary mechanism for community members to propose three broad categories of changes to Chia's ecosystem:

* New features or changes that affect one or more of Chia's protocols
* New features or changes that exist outside of Chia's protocols
* General guidelines that do not propose new features or changes

Each of these CHIP categories will be discussed in more detail in the next section.

Some proposals, including (but not limited to) patches to particular piece of software and certain additions to existing code, do not require a CHIP. Some good question to ask before pursuing a potential CHIP are:

* If my proposal is implemented, will it require standardization between multiple projects?
* Will my proposal affect Chia's community or ecosystem in general (as opposed to only affecting one small part of it)?
* Does my proposal focus on a single key proposal or new idea?

If you answered "no" to either of the first two questions, a CHIP is probably not needed. In this case a simple Github pull request with your proposed changes will probably suffice.

If you answered "no" to the third question, you should break your proposal into multiple pieces and consider submitting more than one CHIP. The more focused your CHIP, the greater its chances of success.

CHIPs need to include the rationale for proposing the new feature or guideline, as well as concise technical details of the feature or guideline being proposed. The CHIP author is responsible for building a concensus within the community to add the new proposal, as well as for documenting any dissenting opinions.

Each CHIP will be recorded publicly, as text files on a versioned repository. This repository will be the historical record for all CHIPs. It will also give authors, as well as end users, a convenient way to ascertain the current status of any given CHIP.


## CHIP categories and sub-categories
* **Standards Track** -- New features or changes that will affect one or more of Chia's protocols, and all Chia implementations. Any change that affects Chia application standards or conventions, as well as the interoperability of applications using CHIA will fall into this category.

  Standards Track CHIPs consist of three parts:

  * A design document
  * A reference implementation
  * An update to the existing formal specification

  Sub-categories of Standards Track CHIPs include:
  * **Core** -- Changes to the block structure, transaction validity rules (including digital signatures), VDF implementation, plot sizes or structure, etc. Some, but not all, Core CHIPs will require a code fork. Therefore, these are the most difficult CHIPs to gain concensus acceptance from the community.
  * **Network** -- Changes to the peer-to-peer network protocol, eg additional specifications for sending messages or storing data.
  * **Interface** --  Changes to the JSON or RPC specifications, as well as changes to any naming conventions. For example, renaming Coloured Coins to CATs.
  * **Chialisp** -- Includes any changes to the Chialisp language, and any implementations thereof. For example, any changes to CAT, NFT, or singleton standards. Also includes changes to library and package formats.

* **Process** -- New features or changes that exist outside of Chia's protocols. These CHIPs typically, but not always, require concensus from the community. They require a design document to be in included in the proposal, and they could also include a reference implementation and an update to existing formal specifications if needed.

  Sub-categories of Process CHIPs include:
  * **Procedural** -- [TODO]
  * **Decision-making** -- includes guidelines [TODO]
  * **Environment** -- includes tooling [TODO]

* **Informational** -- General guidelines that do not propose new features or changes. This CHIPs do not require consensus from the community, so users are free to ignore them.

  Sub-categories of Informational CHIPs include:
  * **Design** -- [TODO]
  * **Guideline** -- Recommendations to Chia community members...[TODO]
  * **Informative** -- New information information regarding one of Chia's processes or procedures...[TODO]


## CHIP workflow

### Parties involved
There are three parties involved with creating and approving each CHIP:

* You -- the CHIP's author and/or its main advocate
* Editors -- those who will [TODO] guide or approve/disapprove?
* Chia developers and management -- [TODO] final say of approval?

### CHIP Status
Regardless of category and sub-category, each CHIP must follow the same workflow, laid out in this diagram:

![CHIP Status Diagram](../TODO)[TODO]

The status of each CHIP will therefore fall into one of the following categories:

**Idea** -- A formal proposal has yet to be written, so it is not being tracked in the CHIP repository. All CHIPs start as _Ideas_.

In this stage of development, you should vet your idea in the #CHIPs channel on our [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/chia_network.public "Chia's Keybase forum") forum. Be sure to gain general agreement from the community that your idea is
  * Original -- it has not been implemented or rejected previously
  * Valuable -- it would help Chia's community and/or ecosystem (and not just the author) if it were implemented
  * Narrow -- it focuses on a single key proposal
  * Feasible -- it is technically sound
  * Compatible -- it doesn't introduce any breaking changes to previous versions
  * Non-complicating -- it doesn't introduce any unnecessary complexities
  * Congruent -- it is harmonious with all of Chia's community guidelines [TODO](add link to guidelines)

If any of these conditions is not met, your CHIP likely will be rejected. To avoid wasting your (or anyone else's) time, be sure to vet your idea with the community before moving forward with a formal proposal.

Only _after_ your idea has met these conditions within the community, you may proceed to the next phase.

**Draft** -- When you are ready to move your proposal into _Draft_, you should fill out the standard [template](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/blob/master/chip-template.md) and submit it as a pull request in the [CHIPs Github repository](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/CHIPs "CHIPs Github repository"). Your CHIP file should be in markdown format and should be named with this format: `chip-<your name>-<your proposal>`.

Be as thorough as possible when filling out the template. Additional details may be added as the review process progresses, but to give your proposal the highest chance of success, it's important to include all relevant information from the beginning. Upon receiving your pull request, a CHIP Editor will make an initial assessment. If your proposal contains all of the necessary material, the Editor will assign it a number.

>Note that you should _not_ attempt to assign a number to your own CHIP.

At this point, your CHIP is a _Draft_. You'll need to present it to the community, using the aforementioned Keybase channel for less formal discussion, and your pull request for more formal comments. It is your responsibility to invite editors, developers, and other interested parties to review your draft, make comments, request changes, and give general feedback.

You will also need to guage interest in your proposal, as well as to figure out how broad the impact will be on Chia's ecosystem if it is implemented. In general, the larger your CHIP's impact (in both breadth and depth), the higher the threshold to gaining approval.

Any negative feedback will be taken into account when deciding whether to move your CHIP to the next phase.

**Review** -- After a sufficient period in _Draft_ (which can vary significantly between CHIPs), when concensus has been reached and all dissenting opinions have been fully addressed, you may request your CHIP's Editor to move your CHIP into _Review_.

At this point, you must ask your peers to review your CHIP. If it is rejected, the Editor will move it back into _Draft_ and make modifications from there. Additionally, if you make any significant changes to your CHIP during this period (anything beyond spelling/grammatical corrections or minor clarifications), your Editor will move your CHIP back into _Draft_.

If there is general concensus during this phase, a CHIP Editor (and not the author) will move the proposal into the next phase.

**Last Call** -- Your CHIP is now ready to be finalized and has entered a waiting period, the deadline of which will be assigned by the CHIP Editor (typically two weeks). During this period, Chia developers and management, as well as community members, may submit their objections to your CHIP being finalized. If _any_ changes are made to the CHIP in this phase, it will be moved back to _Review_. If the deadline is reached with no serious objections and no modifications being made, then it automatically will be moved to _Final_.

**Final** -- This CHIP has been finalized and can no longer be modified, other than by adding errata.

**Stagnant** -- If no modifications have been made to a CHIP that is in _Draft_ or _Review_ for six months, then it is automatically moved to _Stagnant_. The author may move the CHIP back into its prior state at any point in the future.

**Withdrawn** -- You can withdraw your CHIP at any point. Once a CHIP reaches this status, it is final. You can propose the same idea once again in a new CHIP, but you may not re-use this one.

**Living** -- A small number of CHIPs will never be finalized because changes will occasionally need to be made. These CHIPs are considered _Living_, and include chip-0001.

### CHIP template and requirements
All CHIP authors must fill out a [template](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips/blob/master/chip-template.md). Please be as thorough as possible

### Transferring CHIP ownership
Occassionally, it may be necessary to for a new owner to take over an in-progress CHIP. Ideally, the original author will agree to be retained as a co-author, but that's not always possible.

If the original owner has fallen out of contact for a significant period of time (the definition of which will be determined by the CHIP's Editor), and you want to take over ownership of said CHIP, please send a message to the current owner, any existing co-authors, and the Editor, asking for a transferral of ownership to yourself. The Editor will make a subjective decision based on your request.

If you simply disagree with a CHIP's goals, you are not allowed to pursue a transferral of ownership to yourself -- hostile CHIP takeovers will not be tolerated. Instead, you should open a competing CHIP and attempt to convince the community that your proposal is better.

### CHIP editors
The current CHIP Editors are:
[TODO]

### CHIP editor responsibilities and workflow
When a pull request is created for a new CHIP, an Editor must review the template for:
  * Preamble - Have all of the fields been filled out properly? Does it include the email or Github address of at least one author?
  * Abstract - Does it give a succinct and acccurate description of the proposal that could stand on its own?
  * Adherance - Does the template adhere to each of the values listed in the _Idea_ section above (Original, Valuable, Narrow, Feasible, Compatible, Non-complicating, Congruent)?
  * Completeness - Has the template been completely filled out? Does it meet the standards of concise technical standards required for all CHIPs?

If the template does not meet these standards, the Editor should return it to the author for revision.

However, it is important to keep in mind that the Editor must remain a neutral arbitor, akin to a referee. The Editor should refrain from injecting opinions into the discussion and should never reject a CHIP due to a personal disagreement. If an Editor has a personal conflict of interest, they can recuse themselves and a different Editor will take over.

After the editor has determined that the CHIP is ready to be moved into _draft_, they will assign the CHIP with a number and send a message to the author, who will present it to the community for further discussion.

## Style Guide

### EIP numbers

When referring to a CHIP by number, it should be written in the hyphenated form `CHIP-WXYZ` where `WXYZ` is the CHP's assigned number.
